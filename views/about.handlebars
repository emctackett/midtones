    <div class="container">
      <p>The Reading Room was created during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic as a way to foster a sense of community.  The spirit of the app is to provide a social connection for people of all ages, but especially older adults who may be more likely to live alone and become isolated when spending long stretches of time at home.</p>

      <p>Children, or anyone else interested in attending a reading, may share a private virtual room with the adult reader.  Both a visual and audio stream are provided, as well as selection of over fifty fairy tale stories.  Both parties are able to read through the story text together and socialize while remaining healthy and safe in their own homes.</p>

        <p>Manda is a current student at Oregon State University studying in the post-bacc Computer Science program. She loves reading books to her four (soon to be six!) neices and nephews and can appreciate doing so remotely sinc ethey do not live close. She recommends baking up a batch of cookies on both ends of the video chat so you can appreciate a sweet treat to go along with the story. A good chocolate chip cookie with a glass of milk loves nothing more than to be paired with a fairy tale!</p>
